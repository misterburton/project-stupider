# Project Stupider

## Primary Hypothesis to test

OMG, Music is dumbing us down. Horror, Plague, _Locusts!!!!_

**To be Determined:** The Flesch–Kincaid readability index of popular music lyrics is either increasing, decreasing or remaining constant over time.

### Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary, etc. Things to do / test / have fun with

* Has music become more or less grammatically correct?
* How frequently do new words come from pop music?
* How frequently are slang words (non-dictionary words) used? _(A particular challenge, here, is that the dictionary has changed quite a bit in 50 years, so it would be nice to properly account for changes over time)_
* Allow users to enter a single group for reading level analysis or two groups for a _'which one is dumberererrrr'_ head-to-head (Is the fake Genius API fast enough?)
